## About Me

I am a dedicated student with a profound interest in political sciences. My passion for technology is channeled through the Linux operating system, especially Gentoo, which I appreciate for its high degree of customization. I am a strong advocate for open-source principles and actively support the community. Committed to data privacy, I self-host my data to minimize reliance on major corporations.
