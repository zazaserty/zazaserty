<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm zazaserty</h1>
<h3 align="left">As an International Baccalaureate student, my passion for philology and languages has led me to dedicate myself to studying Latin, as well as mastering French, English, and Spanish. My enthusiasm for technology and customization has found a perfect outlet in the Linux operating system, particularly in Gentoo, which offers a high degree of control and satisfaction. Embracing the principles of the open-source movement, I actively support it in any way possible. Furthermore, I advocate for personal data protection and privacy by self-hosting my data and avoiding reliance on Google and other large corporations. As a committed learner, I remain resolute in my pursuit of achieving my goals.</h3>
